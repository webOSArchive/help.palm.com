# Restoring webOS On-Device Help

<img src="http://www.webosarchive.com/help.png">
This is an ongoing effort to make the built-in Help app on webOS devices work again.

## Project Status

At this time the *Touchpad* has most of the Help restored in *English*, *French*, *German* and *Italian*. The *Veer* (running 2.2.4) and *Pre3 have* been tested in *English*, which has been mostly restored for those devices as well.

## Usage

To try it out, you need to show your device where to find the new server:

- The easiest and most thorough way to repair your online experience is to use the webOS Archive Proxy server:
    - <a href="http://www.webosarchive.com/docs/proxysetup/">http://www.webosarchive.com/docs/proxysetup/</a>

- If you'd rather not use a public proxy, you can configure your own proxy, DNS or the hosts file on your device with an entry like this:

`<ipaddress>   help.palm.com`
	
You can find the current IP address of the webOS Archive copy of this content with the command:

`nslookup webosarchive.org`
